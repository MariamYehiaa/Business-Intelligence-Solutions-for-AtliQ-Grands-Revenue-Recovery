Problem statement:AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain in India, has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business segment due to strong competition and poor management decisions. To recover, they aim to use Business and Data Intelligence. However, since they lack an internal data analytics team, their revenue management team decided to hire an external service provider to analyze their historical data and generate useful insights.

what was done in the project:in this project i used dax to make lots of new measures that will be effecient for identifying revenues of the hotel and making comparisons between the weeks to see if there are declination or not, and then after i made the new measures i made some kpis and graphs for easier visualization of the data.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset

The project uses a structured dataset consisting of four CSV files representing a star schema:

- [`dim_date.csv`](./dim_date.csv)  
- [`dim_hotels.csv`](./dim_hotels.csv)  
- [`dim_rooms.csv`](./dim_rooms.csv)  
- [`fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`](./fact_aggregated_bookings.csv)  

These files are used in Power BI to build a star schema model for visualizing hotel performance and business insights.
